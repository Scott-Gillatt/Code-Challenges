#Objects

Challenged with being able to work with objects.  Challenge was when typing into the console, 'that.is.not.funny' it would then print "that.is.not.funny".
It should then if 'that.is.funny' should then print out "that.is.funny".

Needed to print that out without using any kind of function.  So it was meant to be hard-coded.
